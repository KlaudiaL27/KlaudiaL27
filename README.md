Hi there üëã, I'm Klaudia 

## üôç About me:
I am passionate about data science and machine learning, discovering the fascinating world of data analysis. My path to this place was surprising - I graduated from two different fields of study: medical physics and finance and accounting. During my financial studies, I took a job as a junior accountant, where I learned how to use numbers and analyze financial data. üíºüí∞

Already during my first studies, I had the opportunity to come into contact with programming, which inspired me to explore this field. In 2022, I took an intensive Data Science course, which opened the door to the exciting world of data analytics. üìäü§ñ

I am interested not only in data analysis, but also in machine learning and statistics, which allow me to fully use the potential of data to draw valuable conclusions. I am constantly expanding my skills in the field of data science, learning new technologies and methodologies. üìöüöÄ
